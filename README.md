# SemOI_light is a software prototype. It combines image classification with a semantic component. It was developed for the google vision kit. With SemOI there is already an existing image recognition software with a semantic component provided by the university of rostock (https://github.com/Uni-Rostock-Win/SemOI/tree/master/WebApp). This software was the archetype for SemOI light which is a different version of SemOI optimized for the needs of the Google Vision Kit.

To run SemOI light you need a Google Vision Kit with the pre-installed classification model and the standard apis.

runsemoi() initiates the analysis and controlls button and camera to perform an image recognition.

The file "overview_semoilight.pdf" explains the functions of the different components of SemOI light with a brief description.

"The Google Vision Kit is an optimized platform for performing image recognition
tasks. With its minimal hardware components the Google Vision Kit is a very compact
and reduced system. Because of that, it can be seen as a part of the group of IoT devices.
With SemOI there is already an existing image recognition with a semantic augmentation
which is used as the archetype for the new software. The semantic component is based
on a structure called ontology. It provides the information for deducing relations between
recognized odjects and identifying context classes. Because SemOI does not run on the
minimal hardware of the Google Vision Kit, the prototype of a new software similar to
SemOI is developed."
