It was developed for the google vision kit. with semoi there is already an existing image recognition software with a semantic component provided by the university of rostock (https://github.com/Uni-Rostock-Win/SemOI/tree/master/WebApp). this software was used as inspiration and optimized for the needs of the google vision kit.
to run semoi light you need a google vision kit with the pre-installed classification model and the standard apis.

runsemoi() initiates the analysis and controlls button and camera to perform an image recognition.
